Rovio RPG Code Test
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Proud of:
All characters are now one entity type and differentiate by faction.

Things that could be improved:
Detect entities selection not only by their tile click, but also by click on their sprite.
Extract constants that impact visual feel into some settings 

Try to complete this test within 2 weeks. Once completed, please write a summary of things that you are proud of, as well as things that could be improved.

The project contains the visual layer (graphics and effects) of a turn based RPG.
Your task is to design the core game systems and models that drives the visual layer.
This means that you should focus your time on game logic and spend as little time as possible on visuals.
The scene file Main.scene demonstrates how to interact with the visual layer (code available in LevelComponent.Update()).
NOTE: You are allowed to use third-party libraries.

Code requirements (this is the most important part to focus on and what we primarily validate when reviewing your code)
- Your code must follow the KISS and SOLID principles.
- Its better to have multiple smaller classes with specific responsibilities rather then larger classes that does a lot.
- Decouple dependencies as much as possible.
- Prioritize code over visual tools. If you spend time on tools, thats time that could have been used to give us more code to review and make a better judgement of your skills.
- Do not hardcode gameplay variables into your models. For example, its better to set health of a character from the outside (injecting it) rather than hardcoding a default private value within the character model.
- Do not add concepts such as "Armor" or "Sword" directly into a character. These are also gameplay rules that should not be hardcoded. What happens if you would need to support 100 unique type of items for a character? This needs to be dynamic.
- Do not to implement your game logic in the existing services and models within the Assets/Scripts/Presentation folder since we want to decouple presentation logic from game logic. You can however, extend the existing services if there is visual logic missing for your specific implementation.

Gameplay requirements
- [Must have] The game should be playable from the Unity editor using a mouse.
- [Must have] As a player, I should be able to take turns.
- [Must have] As a player, I should be able to move characters.
- [Nice to have] As a player, I should be able to attack opponents.
- [Nice to have] The opponents should be AI controlled.

Gameplay rules example (you do not have to follow these, but they can help you to get started with something)
- Characters have 2 actions per turn. Move and/or attack. They can be triggered in any order.
- Characters can move up to 6 tiles in any direction.
- Characters can not pass through tiles with obstacles or other characters.
- Character movement can be implemented in one of the following ways:
	- Clicking a character should mark that character as selected and display breadcrumbs for all tiles within walking distance.
	OR
	- Clicking and dragging over a character displays a breadcrumbs path from the character tile to the tile at the mouse drag position. Releasing the mouse button triggers the movement.
- Enemies within attack range should be marked with the attack target selection.
- Characters have 2 health points.
- Basic attacks do 1 damage.
- When all characters in a team have 0 health points, the game ends.

Bonus features (if you have time to spare)
- Abilities
	- Weapons that increases damage.
	- Armor that reduces damage.
	- Poison attacks (damage that activates over several turns).
	- Heal spell.
	- Revive spell.
	- Cure (poison) spell.
- Custom levels.
- Ranged attacks.
- Attacks that trigger the quake effect.
- Different enemies.
