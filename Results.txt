please write a summary of things that you are proud of, as well as things that could be improved.


Proud of:
All characters are now one entity type and differentiate by faction.

Things that could be improved:

Interaction between Entity and EntityView:
Right now, after starting an Entity action(move, attack, etc), Entity isn't very good at waiting for EntityView playing all it's visual animations.
I'd imagine some new class like CommandsPlayer. CommandsPlayer would record everything entity needs to do after user input(or AI), then play them with EntityView. After playing the visuals, it would resolve a Promise object, allowing the BattleManager logic to carry on & unblock the user input.
That way the Entity & EntityView would be independent, and a list of commands is a neat way to potentially transmit the battle between network clients or record it.

Entity components
Now there is only one class for all the entities. 
The better way for a flexible system would be to add multiple small components, each one implementing some property of an entity.
Then, for every interaction you can filter objects that have the corresponding component. 
Like if an entity wants to damage something, it can only interact with entities that have a HealthComponent




- Extract constants that impact visual feel into settings(probably a sriptable object)
